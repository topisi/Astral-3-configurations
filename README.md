# Astral-3-configurations

Contains SageMath programs and data about astral 3-configurations A(m,j,k,t),
described in the paper "Chiral Astral Realization of Cyclic 3-configurations"
by Leah Wrenn Berman, Phili DeOrsey, Jill F. Faudree, Tomaž Pisanski and Arjana Žitnik,
published in Discrete & Computational Geometry.

1. There are two figures (png) that need to be in the same directory as the SageMath program.
2. Some data were prodused by an earlier version of this program.

2.1. fromaper.zip contains examples from our paper

2.2. astral_tables continas for each m a file about parameters for configurations

2.3. figures contains two sufolders

pdf with figures in pdf

tikz with figures in latex + tikz.

The program AstralChiral3Configurations.ipynb is a SageMath notebook.
